            Eugene Lazowski born

            </a>

            was a Polish medical doctor who saved thousands of people during World War II
            by creating a fake epidemic which played on German phobias about hygiene.
            He also used his position as a doctor treating people travelling through a nearby
            train station to conceal his supply of medicine to Jews in the local Ghetto,
            which backed on to his home. By doing this, he risked the German death penalty,
            which was applied to Poles who helped Jews in the Holocaust.

            Before the onset of World War II Eugeniusz Łazowski obtained a medical degree at the Józef Piłsudski
            University in Warsaw,
            Poland. During World War II Łazowski served as a Polish Army Second Lieutenant on a Red Cross train,
            then as a military doctor of the Polish resistance Home Army.
            Following the German occupation of Poland Łazowski resided in Rozwadów with his wife and young daughter.
            Łazowski spent time in a prisoner-of-war camp prior to his arrival in the town, where he reunited
            with his family and began practicing medicine with his medical-school friend Dr Stanisław Matulewicz.
            Using a medical discovery by Matulewicz, that healthy people could be injected with a strain of Proteus
            that
            would make them test positive for typhus without experiencing the disease,
            Łazowski created a fake outbreak of epidemic typhus in and
            around the town of Rozwadów (now a district of Stalowa Wola),
            which the Germans then quarantined.
            This saved an estimated 8,000 people from being sent to
            German concentration camps during the Holocaust.

            In 1958, Lazowski emigrated to the United States on a scholarship from the Rockefeller Foundation and in
            1976 became professor of pediatrics at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He wrote a memoir entitled
            Prywatna wojna (My Private War) which was reprinted several times, as well as over a hundred scientific
            dissertations.
            Lazowski retired from practice in the late 1980s. He died in 2006 in Eugene, Oregon, where he had been
            living with his daughter.
